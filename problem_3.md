## Rearrange Array Elements

For this problem, I used the quicksort algorithm from the class to sort the array in descending order, and the two integers are obtained by combine the even/odd places of digit together into a integer.  

Time Complexity: O(Nlog(N)), where N is the length of array. From quicksort.  
Space complexity: O(1), only some costant number of variables are created.
