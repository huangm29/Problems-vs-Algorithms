##Dutch National Flag Problem

For this problem, I used a sort algorithm from the class. If the element is 0, we swap this element to with the element at the beginning part of the array; if the element is 2, we swap this element with the element at the ending part of the array; If the element is 1, we can leave it as it is.

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of array. We only traverse the array, in the worst case, twice. 

Space complexity: O(1), no extra space is needed.
